# Web Developer Resources

## Introduction

<br>

This is a biased compilation of technologies that are useful to learn in order to get a job as a web developer. It is in my opinion the smallest set of technologies you need to know about in order to work on the full stack of a website. Deployment will be avoided in this document since it is out of the strict scope of *developer* guide. Since most people use Windows, this guide will assume use Windows. I suggest, if possible and you're interested, using WSL2 in order to have a mostly Linux development environment, or just using Linux or Mac. All the technologies in this document work natively on all platforms, so using Windows is absolutely fine for all of our purposes.

### List of technologies in order and Explanation

<br>

This document will start with setting up a development environment. It will be the quickiest to set up, free, easy to use and very light. I suggest starting with VScode, for its flexibilty, lightness, and extensibility.
The "necessary" extension are few and work pretty well out of the box.

Then I think at least a bit of familiarity with programming in general will be useful, so I'd start with Typescript. Why Typescript? Well, the smallest stac of technologies in order to make a modern website at this point in time is:


- HTML because it's literally how your write the visible part of the website
- CSS because it makes your HTML pretty
- JavaScript because it makes your website interactive
- Also JavaScript using NodeJS which makes the backend for your website


Additionally I would start getting familiar with at least one of the major frontend frameworks because learning them teaches you a lot of how you build the frontend of a website.

But JavaScript will teach you bad habits, and  learning how languages use static typechecking will turn out useful if you want to get to other, more performant backend languages in the future. So TypeScript is perfect for that, when learning it you learn JavaScript too, but you get type checking, also most frameworks support it almost natively and it is much better if you work in a team.
